My Vim configuration
====================

This setup is mostly used with MacVim and might not work with other Vim implementations.

* You will need to modifying this. [Do so](http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com)! I need my shortcuts, you need yours. This vimrc is in constant development and its creation took about three years. You will not be able to used it out of the box ;).
* The plugins system is based on [Plug.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).
* You can clone this in any directory and need something like `source $HOME/path/to/vim/vimrc.vim` to make this work.
* Fire up vim, run `:PlugInstall` and everything is installed.
